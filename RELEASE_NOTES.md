# Release Notes

## v1.1.29
GH#745 — declare per-step `output: {name, type}` on every execution step (source_evaluation/text, reading_analysis/text, notes/text, interpretation/text, citations/list, polished_output/text). Lights up the #744 rich flow-map with named, typed outputs. Content-only; no bindings or logic changes.

## v1.1.28
GH#645 Row 3b — migrate to K-037 dep-referenced schema. Strip 14 inline shared-content files and declare 14 hub-shared deps (UUID id + slug name + version + checksum from `gen-dep-checksums.mjs`). Closes pre-Step-3 inline-vendoring for this bundle.
